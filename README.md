LeetCode Challenges
Underneath you may see, challenges from LeetCode, done by marked as solved optimal, solved suboptimal, unsolved, depending on the stage of the problem that I am currently in, I do these challenges solely on my own, without any help either by checking other works, or using some ai help. Everything is done solely by me, and you can use the code below, for anything that is not commercial.

20_Valid_parentheses -> solved, optimal
32_Longest_valid_parentheses -> solved, suboptimal
2_Add_two_numbers -> solved, optimal

Soon I shall add new changes to the structures of this .txt, but currently I'd rather stay on the verge of relying on data within structures of this repo.
